# ML-for-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

##Main Challenges in Credit Card Fraud Detection

- **Enormous data** processed daily requires fast models to respond to fraud in real-time[1][3]
- **Imbalanced data**, with 99.8% of transactions being non-fraudulent, makes detecting fraud difficult[3][6]
- **Limited data availability** as most data is private[3][6]
- **Misclassified data** where not all fraudulent transactions are caught and reported[6]
- **Adaptive techniques** used by fraudsters against detection models[3][7]

## Tackling the Challenges

- Use **simple, fast models** to quickly detect and classify anomalies as fraudulent[7]
- Deal with imbalance using appropriate methods like oversampling, undersampling, or cost-sensitive learning[3][6]
- Reduce **data dimensionality** to protect user privacy while maintaining performance[6]
- Use **trustworthy data sources** to train more accurate models[6]
- Make models **simple and interpretable** to adapt quickly when fraudsters change tactics[3][7]
